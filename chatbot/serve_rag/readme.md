The best results usually come if you specifiy which HW assignment and which question for example:
    " for HW3Q2 ...."

"for HW3Q4 Hi I tried, changing the datatype to decimal for 4.4 but still getting this error and when change the output to decimaltype gradescope is crashing, can you pls check my submission and tell me what I am doing wrong:"

Hi,

I asked this question in the HW3 Q3 thread a few times but still haven't gotten any answers, so I'm asking again here. In gradescope for part e, I get the error 
Test Failed: [-2]: Dataframe returned from final_ouput() has incorrect data

which I understand has to do with precision accumulation. I went back and changed my precision of the average values to decimal(38,14) and the counts to long. I have also tried different permutations of decimal parameters, and in different locations in part d and e, and I'm still getting 2 points off because of that error. I get full points on all my other questions.

Please advise on why none of my casting is working. The error of gradescope doesn't give me any further information, and I don't understand where else could be going wrong, particularly because everything else is correct.

Thanks,

Uri

"""When testing my code at the bottom for the exclude_no_pickuplocations and exclude_no_tripdistance functions (parts B and C), I am getting counts of records back. 

But when I submit in gradescope, it is saying 'The dataframe you returned has 0 records' 

Any ideas where I am going wrong?

query = """for HW2q2 I see that the code already has the .call(d3.drag() function within the node variable. When comparing it to the example provided I also see that they have that portion. We were also given the functions dragged and dragended so I am not sure how is what we have different from what we need to do for the part d of the question? What portion of the example code  javascript - Fix Node Position in D3 Force Directed Layout - Stack Overflow given is what we need?"""

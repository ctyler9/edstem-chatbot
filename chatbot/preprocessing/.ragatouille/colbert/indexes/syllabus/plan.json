You are expected to quickly learn many things simultaneously, and for some materials you will need to learn them on your own (e.g., Linux commands, for working with MS Azure\/Amazon AWS). This can be very intimidating for many students.\n\nThe amounts of time students spend on this class greatly vary, based on their backgrounds, and what they may already know. Some former students told us they spent about 40-60 hours on each homework assignment (we have 4 big assignments, and no exams), and some reported much less. For example, for the homework assignment covering D3 visualization programming students who are completely new to javascript, css, and html likely will spend significantly more time than those of their peers who have prior experience with these technologies. Some former students lacking a strong computer science background report having found the homework assignments quite challenging and demanding of significant time and effort. But they also report having found them rewarding, fun, and \"do-able.\"\n\nStudents have at least 3 weeks to complete each homework assignment.

            "Students have at least 3 weeks to complete each homework assignment. In the past, some students have waited until the last week to begin, and could not finish. It is critical to plan ahead and prepare for the significant time required to complete the homework assignments.\nAlmost all homework assignments involve very large amounts of programming (which naturally means that a lot of debugging will likely be needed. This can be time consuming, and students should be prepared for the time commitment required.) You should be proficient in at least one high-level programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java), and should be efficient with debugging principles and practices. For students not meeting these expectations, we recommend taking introductory computing course(s) before taking this course (for exmaple, CSE 6040 for (OMS) Analytics students; CS 1301, CS 1331, CS 1332, CS 1371, etc. for on-campus students).\n\nSome programming assignments involve high-level languages or scripting (e.g., Python, Java, SQL etc.). Some assignments involve web programming and D3 (e.g., Javascript, CSS, HTML).",
            "for on-campus students).\n\nSome programming assignments involve high-level languages or scripting (e.g., Python, Java, SQL etc.). Some assignments involve web programming and D3 (e.g., Javascript, CSS, HTML). For example, an assignment on Hadoop and Spark may require you to learn some basic Java and Scala quickly, which should not be too challenging if you already know another high-level language like Python or C++. It is unlikely that you know all of the tools\/skills needed in every programing task, so you are expected to learn many of them on the fly.\n\nBasic linear algebra, probability and statistics knowledge is also expected.\nMinimum Computer Requirements\n\n    8GB RAM (16GB recommended)\n    512GB disk (SSD recommended). Some assignments use data files that are more than a few GBs, and some uses virtual machines that can easily take up more than tens of GBs. It is typical for some project teams to use large datasets that are more than a few or tens of GBs.\n    Dual-core Core i5 (8th generation or better recommended), or Mac with M1 processor or better\n\nAccessing Course Materials Outside of US\nYou may need to use Georgia Tech's VPN.",

I may lower (and never raise) the thresholds (i.e., to your benefits). For example, I may use 88 instead of 90.\n\nPlagiarism, Collaboration Policy, and Student Honor Code\n\n    All course participants (myself, teaching assistants, and learners) are expected to know and abide by the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code.\n    Ethical behavior is extremely important in all facets of life.\n\n    Plagiarism is a serious offense. You are responsible for completing your own work. You are not allowed to copy and paste, or paraphrase, or submit materials created or published by others, as if you created the materials. All materials submitted must be your own.\n    You may discuss high-level ideas with other students at the \"whiteboard\" level (e.g., how cross validation works, use hashmap instead of array) and review any relevant materials online. However, each student must write up and submit his or her own answers.",

However, each student must write up and submit his or her own answers.\n    You must not put your code on public domain (e.g., public GitHub), because a (future) student could copy your code. That student obviously violates the honor code, and you may also be implicated.\n    All incidents of suspected dishonesty, plagiarism, or violations of the Georgia Tech Honor Code will be subject to the institute\u2019s Academic Integrity procedures (e.g., reported to and directly handled by the Office of Student Integrity (OSI)). Consequences can be severe, e.g., academic probation or dismissal, grade penalties, a 0 grade for assignments concerned, and prohibition from withdrawing from the class.\n\nLate Policy and Due Dates\n\n    All homework and project deliverables are due at the times shown in the Course Schedule.

Convert the times to your local times using a Time Zone Converter.\n    Every homework assignment deliverable and every project deliverable comes with a 48-hour \"grace period\".\n        The grace period is a lenient buffer. Do not use the grace period to begin new work or modify existing work (e.g., submit revised code to Gradescope). In other words, your official final submission must complete before the grace period begins (e.g., fully uploaded, code finished running).\n        If a student decides to make a submission during the grace period, they are responsible for all issues associated with that submission (e.g., any Gradescope errors, including those triggered by student\u2019s syntax errors that crash Gradescope).\n        Course staff support is not guaranteed during the grace period; we provide help only when available.\n        You do not need to ask before using the grace period.\n        Any submission that does not complete by the end of the grace period will receive 0 point.

Submit your work before the grace period begins.\n    For Canvas, a submission made during the grace period will be marked as \"late\", without point deduction. Canvas automatically appends a \"version number\" to files that you re-submit. You do not need to worry about these version numbers, and there is no need to delete old submissions. We will only grade the most recent submission.\n    For Gradescope, a submission made during the grace period will be marked as \"late\", without point deduction. Each submission and its score will be recorded and saved by Gradescope. By default, Gradescope uses your last submission for grading. To use a different submission, you must \"activate\" it prior to the end of the grace period (click \u201cSubmission History\u201d button at bottom toolbar, then \u201cActivate\u201d).\n    We will not consider late submission of any missing parts of a deliverable.

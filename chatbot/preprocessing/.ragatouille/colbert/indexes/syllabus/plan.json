We will cover methods from each side, and hybrid ones that combine the best of both worlds. Students will work in small teams to complete a significant project exploring novel approaches for interactive data & visual analytics.\nCourse Goals\n\n    Learn visual and computational techniques and tools, for typical data types\n        Learn how to complement each kind of method\n        Gain a breadth of knowledge\n    Work on real datasets and problems\n    Learn practical know-how (useful for jobs, research) through significant hands-on programming assignments\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank the generous support of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for free cloud credits, Intel for curriculum development of the memory mapping module (scaling up algorithms with virtual memory), and Tableau for data visualization software.\nAnnouncements and Discussion\n\nWe use Edstem for all announcements and discussion. Everyone must join this class's Ed Discussion through Canvas. Double check that you are joining the correct Edstem! There are multiple concurrent course sections with the same name and course number taking place, e.g., online for OMSA and OMSCS, and campus for Atlanta-based students.",
                "Everyone must join this class's Ed Discussion through Canvas. Double check that you are joining the correct Edstem! There are multiple concurrent course sections with the same name and course number taking place, e.g., online for OMSA and OMSCS, and campus for Atlanta-based students.\nStudents must always use Ed Discussion to communicate with course staff or for any class-related questions. Ed Discussion will be used for general posts, including private and public posts, threads, mega threads, Q&A, and announcements.\nIf course staff needs to communicate with specific students (i.e. members of a project team), the Ed Chat feature of Ed Discussion will be used. Students can benefit from this feature to communicate with other students. e.g., to discuss forming a project.\n\nIMPORTANT: Everyone must ensure that the notification setting is on for both Ed Discussion and its Ed Chat feature to stay up to date with the class requirements and prevent losing points because of missing updates and announcements on Ed Discussion.\n\nThe fastest way to get help with homework assignments is to post your questions on Ed Discussion. That way, you can get help from our TAs and instructor as well as your peers."
